 ## Project File Description
I took this Data from Kaggle.com, the dataset was under the name of "Atlix - Data Cleaning to Data Viz" by **Vikram Amin**.
The required tools were Mysql and Tableau, but I chose to work with SQL Server and Power.

## Case Description
'Problem Statement:

Mr. Bhavin Shah (Sales Director) at Atlix is not getting his sales data on time. The sales data given to him is not in a structured manner. As a result, he is unable to make any concrete and specific business decisions.

Data Discovery:
The AIMS grid consists of 4 parts
Purpose: To unlock the sales insights that can help in decision-making and to automate data which can reduce the time in collecting the said data.
Stakeholders: Sales Director, Marketing Team, Customer Service Team, Data Analytics Team & IT
End Result: An automated and interactive dashboard that can provide sales insights to help in the decision-making process
Success Criteria: The dashboard will provide the latest sales data which will help in improving the sales and reduce costs. We can set a target of say 10% increase in sales and a 5% reduction in costs.
The sales Team will have ownership of all the sales transactions which are stored in a database called MySql. The data analysts’ team will ask for the said sales data to analyze the same and create a dashboard encapsulating the data.'

## Project Steps
