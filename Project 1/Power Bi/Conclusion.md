# Conclusion

The dashboard prepared is an interactive dashboard with filters.
For example, by clicking on 'Central', the geographic zone of the markets, the results change in the other charts, which will now show the results pertaining only to 'Central' markets.
A parameter with a filter has also been created for the top customers and products on their pages.
The Dashboard can slide through 3 pages that contain brief information about each subject in graphs, with one common graph (Sales Trend): 
1. Market page
2. Product page
3. Customer page
