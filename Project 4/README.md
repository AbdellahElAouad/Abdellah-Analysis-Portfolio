# Newsfeed Analysis Project

## About the Project
This Project was a part of a data analytics course in the platform [365datascience.com](https://365datascience.com/), the working steps were followed by a quiz to review the personal outcome.

### Objective:
My main goal is to generate graphs that analyze users’ interaction patterns with the 365 platform’s Newsfeed service. For this purpose, I must craft a data visualization in Tableau that captures critical findings from **01-01-2023** to **05-31-2023**. Building this Tableau dashboard from scratch, utilizing it to deduce necessary conclusions and recommend potential refinements.

## Interpreting the Results
  1. After examining all subtypes using the appropriate dashboard filter, it's evident that the Level-type and Collection-type posts are the least popular. This observation is supported by the graph showing monthly average likes and the ratio of likes to the total number of posts.

**_Collection_**: Out of of **9,376** posts **170** received likes
**_Level_**: Out of **22,313** posts, **422** received likes.
The notably low average of around **0.02** likes per post for both categories underscores this conclusion.

  2. The _Subtype Post Distribution_ visualization indicates that the Level-type posts are the most prevalent, appearing **22,313** times, whereas the Career Track Certificate posts are the least frequent, with only **144** instances. The count is comparable to the second least common post subtype—the manual Text post, with **150** examples.

  3. By dividing the number of active users by the overall visitors and multiplying by **100**, we get the engagement rate in percentage. Using this formula, **405** divided by **3956** yields an engagement rate of **10%.**

  4. Level-type posts dominate the newsfeed, appearing twice as often as the next most common type, Course Certificate posts. However, they, along with Collection posts, generate very little user engagement, like likes or interactions. 

This suggests that these posts might be overwhelming the newsfeed with less interesting content, affecting the overall user experience. A better approach could be to reduce their frequency and prioritize more engaging posts to boost user interaction and keep the feed interesting.
